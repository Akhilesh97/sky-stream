### What is your team for the project?
- Steven, Shresta, Akhilesh
### What is the topic/focus of your project?
- The main goal of the project is to create a tool that can forecast aircraft delays almost instantly. This implies that the system must be able to offer current information regarding the likelihood of an aircraft being delayed or arriving on schedule.
  
### What problem does it solve? Why is it useful?
- The common travel-related issues of uncertainty, time management, and stress will be addressed by this flight delay prediction dashboard tailored to a particular demographic. It will provide a number of advantages such as informed decision-making, stress reduction, time savings, and enhanced travel experiences overall. It will prove to be a useful instrument for improving the travel experience since it meets the needs of both passengers and the aviation sector.

### What data does it use?
- Data from opensky provides real time streaming. The python api provides data on - 
  -  Retrieves flights for a certain airport which arrived within a given time interval
  - Retrieves flights for a certain airport which arrived within a given time interval
  - Retrieves data of flights for certain aircraft and time interval.
  - Retrieves data of flights for certain time interval
  - Retrieve state vectors for a given time. If time = 0 the most recent ones are taken.
  - Retrieve the trajectory for a certain aircraft at a given time. The tracks endpoint is purely experimental.

- Data from open weather data shall provide real time weather data which will be used to make predictions into the future for flight delays. 

### What are the tools and technologies that you are planning to use?
### What is the planned architecture?
### What is the planned delivery format? (Website/App? Dashboard? etc...)
### What are the difficulties you're facing, if any?
